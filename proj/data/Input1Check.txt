some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-

the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway.

"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it?

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!

I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."

COMMENDATORY VERSES 10FROM  SOLISDANTo Don Quixote of La ManchaSONNETYour fantasies, Sir Quixote, it is true,That crazy brain of yours have quite upset,But aught of base or mean hath never yetBeen charged by any in reproach to you.Your deeds are open proof in all men's view;For you went forth injustice to abate,And for your pains sore drubbings did you getFrom many a rascally and ruffian crew.If the fair Dulcinea, your heart's queen,Be unrelenting in her cruelty,If still your woe be powerless to move her,In such hard case your comfort let it beThat Sancho was a sorry go-between:A booby he, hard-hearted she, and you no lover.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

"Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these.At any rate it is plain that in its 
construction Jervas's translation was very freelydrawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original
Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,which appeared in 1769, 
"printed for the Translator," was an impudent imposture,being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words,
here andthere, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was only an abridgment likeFlorian's, but not so skilfully 
executed; and the version published by Miss Smirkein 1818, to accompany her brother's plates, was merely a patchwork 
productionmade out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be inevery sense of the word 
impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not evenseen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, 
and since then I maysay vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield's 
reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of 
"Don Quixote," it will beseen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrativewith its full
complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in aform that amuses them, care very little whether 
that form is the one in which Cer-vantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there aremany 
who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it,so far at least as differences of idiom 
and circumstances permit, and who will giv

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle.

COMMENDATORY VERSES 9THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thinePhoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mineThat smote from east to west as lightnings fly.I scorned all empire, and that monarchyThe rosy east held out did I resignFor one glance of Claridiana's eye,The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.A miracle of constancy my love;And banished by her ruthless cruelty,This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.

some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have men-tioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes andmiseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortalenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him captive,gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied toone of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of nosmall authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pit-fall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on falling found himselfbound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to himone of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh fin-ished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, agreat friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I maywell suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know,Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be inhand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in expresswords: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has inhis hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason thathe whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imag-ine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore sufferedany indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, werenothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger."
"They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly had Ilaid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with theirsticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out ofmy feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all thosestake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain ofthe blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as onmy  shoulders.""For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that there isno recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death doesnot remove.""And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the one thatwaits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were oneof those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I ambeginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to putus right.""No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,"returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me thatnot the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.""There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-er-rant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free wherewe come out scotched."
"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,"said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast may now supply the want ofRocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of mywounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for Iremember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of thegay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates, went very con-tentedly mounted on a handsome ass.""It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered San-cho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung likea sack of manure."To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour in-stead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee be-fore, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whateverfashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us inthese  wilds.""And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it verygood fortune.""That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they are inlove; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained twoyears on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, withouttheir ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -I know notif it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; atany rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the PrincessOriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste beforea mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.""The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty"ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations onwhomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with allhis pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had hepossessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his mas-ter would have been behind him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on theass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, heproceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to bet-ter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he per-ceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote mustneeds be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was notone, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settledthey had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.
CHAPTER XVIOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUSGENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE ACASTLETHE innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho whatwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallendown from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wifewhose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for shewas by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she atonce set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a verycomely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, asservant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, madeup for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and hershoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the groundmore than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs ofhaving formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was alsoquartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the ad-vantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not
very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, fullof pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to thetouch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and acoverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without miss-ing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and herdaughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes- forthat was the name of the Asturian- held the light for them, and while plasteringhim, the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places,remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projec-tions, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manageto save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins tooare rather sore.""Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess."I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at seeing mymaster fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.""That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time happened tome to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to theground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken asif  I  had  really  fallen."
"There is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreamingat all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less whealsthan my master, Don Quixote.""How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian."Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world thislong time past.""What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass."Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza."Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in twowords is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needybeing in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms togive  his  squire.""Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this,you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?""It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month goingin quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be calledone, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found;however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am leftnone the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sit-ting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said toher, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castleof yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it isbecause of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will in-form you who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on mymemory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitudewhile life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled andsubject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between myteeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty."The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilder-ment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much ofthem as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were allmeant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomedto this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for heseemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thank-ing him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night, andshe had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleepshe would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is saidof this good lass that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
even though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for sheplumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an em-ployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck hadbrought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Qui-xote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sanchomade his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if itwas of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that ofthe carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, andin prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to theauthor of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besides whichCide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in allthings, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that havebeen already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an ex-ample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions socurtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the workbeing left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thou-sand blessings on the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the otherbook in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minute-ness  they  describe  everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them theirsecond feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting forhis conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time plastered and had laindown, and though he strove to sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, whileDon Quixote with the pain of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The innwas all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by alantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, andthe thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described atevery turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was thathe fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all theinns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the innkeeperwas daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing,had fallen in love with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while thatnight without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that hehad constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilousrisk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to com-mit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour- an un-lucky one for him- arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with barefeet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps en-
